Hi there!

Merge was originally developed to run disk operating system under UNIX systems.
merge was developed by engineers at locus computing corporation,
so merge or merging is the process of taking two or more groups of data combining
Them into a single set or one file if you must.

so what i understand is that merging is done in systems where changes in data
are combined git for example is what i think is one of the tools used to merge changes in data
Or the whole file in general.

I read on stack overflow that merge Request and Pull request git chooses the name pull request since the first manual action would be to pull the feature branch. Tools such as GitLab and Gitorious choose the name merge request since that is the final action that is requested of the assignee.
so to merge id to combine things into one single activity.
