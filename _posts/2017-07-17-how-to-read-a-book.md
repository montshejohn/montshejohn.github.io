### how to read a book 

So I just read this article on how to read a book by Mortimer Adler.
I never thought that there are ways on how to read I just thought reading was 
Just reading.

Now today I learned that there are four levels / methods of reading a book
those four methods are :1.elementary 
                        2. inspection 
                        3. Analytical 
                        4. synoptical 
with this above mentioned levels reading becomes more interesting more entertaining and of course
knowledgeable. I have reason to believe that there is a whole lot of information in this world 
that we aren't aware of and of that info 80% of  the information is written down in books.it can be any book
it can be the Guinness world records book it can be the rich dad poor dad book
Or even animal farm.Check out how to read a book by Mortimer Adler it will change your reading experience!
