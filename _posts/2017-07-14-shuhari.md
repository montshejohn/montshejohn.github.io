###Shu  ha ri : how we learn.

Monday: 24/07/2017

Hey there! This is yours truly at it again.
Hope you doing well there.Now have you asked your self ,how do we learn? Or maybe just like me you thought learning is just something that just happens in a naturally without any concept behind it.
Well, if true guess what theres actually some concepts behind this learning thing, and one of then is what they call SHUHARI<br> you probably thinking that the name sounds weird right ? I know I thought so as well anyway it's a Japanese martial art concept that describes the stages of learning to mastery look up shuhari on wiki to find out more about this concept it will change your life! 
from yours truly u know whats what 
peace!
