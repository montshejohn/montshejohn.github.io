#Thinking of building sites using a cool framework based on react ??

###Gatsby is a free and open-source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing-fast websites and apps
[source to the official docs] (https//:gatsbyjs.org)

In this post, we explore the building blocks of using Gatsby js to see how it could help 
Build Modern sites and more. Mind you most of the information in this post is thoroughly explained and available at the official gatsby page I will just be going through parts of the tutorial and sharing synopsis of what you can expect. With a little bit of knowledge in HTML Javascript CSS and React.js, the Docs will be relatively easier to comprehend.

### Let’s dive in what’s in their tutorial part by part.

In the first part, we learn about how the folder structure is set up similarly in a react project where you have a folder for your pages/components. if you are familiar with react.js think of the first part as a refresher to working with JSX, building with components, using layout components and linking between components and if you're not familiar with react this would be a great introduction to some of the building blocks.

Moving on to the second part...
In the second part, we are introduced to options for styling your Gatsby pages 
There are  options are to use  traditional CSS creating  global styles with standard CSS files 
Using component scoped CSS modules ,CSS in JS & other cool CSS options.

##### Third part…  in this part we are introduced to Gatsby plugins !!!

> Gatsby plugins are JavaScript packages that help add functionality to a Gatsby site. Gatsby is designed to be extensible, which means plugins are able to extend and modify just about everything Gatsby does.

 you can install the packages using npm and probably yarn.

> Our goal with plugins is to make them straightforward to install and use. You will likely be using plugins in almost every Gatsby site you build. While working through the rest of the tutorial you’ll have many opportunities to practice installing and using plugins

in this part, you will get a quick tutorial of creating a smaller site that has a navbar you can use to navigate through to different pages by creating layout components and routing to different pages using the navigation links

In the fourth part, we explore the gatsby data layer which is a powerful feature that let’s build sites from Wordpress, markdown headless CMS & other data sources then we learn how Gatsby’s data layer uses GraphQL to pull data into components. Links to the GraphQL docs are included on there in case are you are unfamiliar with GraphQL

When are now entering part 5 of the tutorial so far so good I must say it’s well documented and easy to follow along.. in fact, I am surprised you got this far without trying the actual docs yourself .. but I appreciate it. Now on part five, we learn about pulling data into our sites using graph and source plugins. we start with an introduction to GraphiQl.

> Source plugins fetch data from their source. E.g. the filesystem source plugin knows how to fetch data from the file system. The WordPress plugin knows how to fetch data from the WordPress API."

> GraphiQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE). It’s a powerful (and all-around awesome) tool you’ll use often while building Gatsby websites"
in this part, you will learn how to build a page with a GraphQL query.
