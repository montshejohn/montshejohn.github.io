# Introduction 

My name is Johannes Mokgokong I am one of the  students at TCG (the coding ground).
I am a young man from Diepsloot with a huge pattion of computer programming,I joined the coding
ground in 2017 and I believe that year was the beggining of a new chapter in my life. Before the coding ground 
I was a part of a Saturday school called Sisonke Rising where I got introduced to computer programming thats where I gained interest that Saturday School went and became the coding ground and thats where we learn about 
cool stuff making online apps,websites,mobile apps  and much more.

## 

Because of organizations like the coding ground the chances of leading a better life are satisfactory.
because not only do learn about how to write code we learn how to effectively communicate with others
by working in teams this helps us improve our way or resolving differences we may come to face and also helps 
us become better people. at the moment we are learning  a programming language called Javascript and also a spoken Language called English which this blog post is written in..as people of color most of us cannot speak this language proficiently and this somehow becomes an issue as most points can not be driven across because they are weakly held (language barrier);

### conclusion 
I learned that the coding ground recieved a donation.
I feel very delighted about this because this shows that we on a path that people believe in, which is a good motivation.
