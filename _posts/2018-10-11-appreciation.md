# Introduction

My name is Johannes Mokgokong I am one of the  students at TCG (the coding ground).
I am a young man from Diepsloot with a huge passion of computer programming,I joined the coding
ground in 2017 and I believe that  that year was the beginning of a new and exciting chapter in my life. Before the coding ground
I was a part of a Saturday school called Sisonke Rising where I got introduced to computer programming that's where I gained interest that Saturday School went and became the coding ground and that's where we learn about
cool stuff making online apps,websites,mobile apps  and much more.

##  .

Because of organizations like the coding ground the chances of leading a better life are satisfactory.
because not only do learn about how to write code we learn how to effectively communicate with others
by working in teams, this helps us improve our way or resolving differences we may come to face and also helps
us become better people. At the moment we are learning  a programming language called JavaScript and also because of we come from different ethnic groups  I feel like we are also learning  spoken Languages such as English Zulu and Sepedi ... as people of color most of us cannot speak the English language proficiently and this generally becomes an issue. Most points can not be driven across because they are weakly held (language barrier);

###  .
I learned that the coding ground recieved a donation .
with this donation I believe we can get more learning resources more working tools to increase our productivity
and more time to learn new technologies and hopefully get more people joining the coding ground.
I feel very delighted when people contribute organizations like  this because this shows that we on a path that people believe in, which is a good motivation for us to work even harder make sure we learn to understand all that we can.

Its the organizations like these that make difference in life, They  change our lives for the greater good
Hopefully one day we will be the ones providing assistance to those in need.
thank you for reading.
