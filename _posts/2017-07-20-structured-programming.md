Hi there! 

Structured programming 

Structured programming is a  programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity,quality and development time
of a computer program  by making extensive use of subroutines,block structures, for and while loops 
In contrast to using simple tests such as go to statements.

 It emerged in the late 50s coined by a dutch computer scientist Edsger w djikstra.
But Structured programming was first suggested by Corrado Bohm and Guiseppe Jacopini. The two mathematicians demonstrated that any computer program can be written with just three structures: decisions, sequences, and loops. Edsger Dijkstra's subsequent article, Go To Statement Considered Harmful was instrumental in the trend towards structured programming.
  i personally believe that because of this the ways of writing programs has become much 
More clearer and more adaptable, I am relatively new to this programming space but so far with my encounter with languages that uses structured languages like python I have reasons to say that the experience wasn’t that bad compared to my attempt to learn assembly.
