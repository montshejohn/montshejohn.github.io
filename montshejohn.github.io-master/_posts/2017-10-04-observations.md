observations

learner and fellow student at TCG I'll be writing about my observations so far, what I learned, and how we learn as free code camp

is almost like our primary source I have learned a lot from it and of-course thanks to the guidance and mentorship from the founders of TCG and my fellow students of which I learn with

it becomes less difficult to record information and learn effectively

HTML 5

Starting of the course we learned html 5 (Hyper Text Markup Language) it a markup up language for creating

Web pages and Web apps. I learned on how to use html elements which are the blocks of building a web page.

I have even built my own personal portfolio page using html and technologies such as CSS (cascaded Style Sheet) jquery and bootstrap.. I would like to believe that html is not really difficult to learn. I mean it did not take us long here at  TCG to get a tight grip on it.



JavaScript

an interpreted programming language used to create stuff like interactive web site/pages, online games to name a few of its capabilities.

It isn't hard learning how to code using javaScript with more practise ofcourse .But then again its not entirely easy as well.

I have done the basics of JS I understand the syntax,  by far know the basics camelCasing commenting etc., i have moved to intermediate JavaScript i have

learned about data types control structures, functions objects, operators and native objects..

I mean all that anybody can learn, slight difficulty I face though is using logic. If only I could write my own code that performs a certain action without the aid of and stack overflow google that would be awesome!!


Conclusion Coding is fun I mean I think it is one of the best careers one can pursue in this world. I personally enjoy every day of TCG I would like to say thanks to the founders of TCG For making it happen. with all that I have learned I will work harder on improving and make my way to Mastering this craft stay tuned for an update god speed us on this journey of becoming software craftsmen
