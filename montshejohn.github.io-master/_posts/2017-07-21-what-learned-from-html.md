hi there 
today s blog is about what i learned from HTML 

now i know that HTML provides a page with a structure and then
CSS provides the appearance like the font family and colors.
now thats some of of the basics things one needs in order to 
create a website.even i myself used them i wrote or say created 
my first web about a month ago the experience was cool you know.
well at first it didn't look that great,still doesn't ill need to work on it a bit to enhance it more maybe add some bootstrap there 
and JavaScript to spice it up a little.HTML is wonderful it gives you the ability to design stuff from scratch makes you feel in complete control of everything you do there you are the artist and HTML is the canvas,
so there are tons of things i learned from there and i cant really put them in words..
if you are new to this HTML thing you can just go read on on the web and maybe try freecodecamp /academy you can learn tons of stuff from there 
thanks for reading.
peace!!
