its a great skill to posses especially for those in software 
development,
there are approx four techniques that people use when typing 
those techniques are 
1. Touch typing
2. Hunt and peck
3. Hybrid
4. buffering
unfortunately i won't go in detail on them as this blog is intended to show my progress in learning how to type.
but if you u feel like its  interesting  and you need more info on the above mentioned you can visit the provided link below 
never the less here is my progress in touch typing 
i am currently sitting on an average of 42 wpm with the accuracy of 95 on a good day 
i wish to improve, but by  rapidly  practicing every single day and doing  
lessons on typing club.com as well as racing on type racer i am pretty confident that i will improve.
check it out its fun!!
