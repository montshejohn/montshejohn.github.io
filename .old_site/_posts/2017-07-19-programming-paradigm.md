Hi there I hope you doing well! welcome to yet another blog by yours truly.
thursday 20-july.

the topic of day will be based on the difference between different programming paradigm mainly functional and procedural programming it is said that Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features therefore  Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.so as i said i will only be blogging on functional and procedural.So in functional programming it said that it's   a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs.It expresses the logic of a model without describing its order,in which individual statements instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed.in simple mans terms what this probably means is that functional languages  allows you to write a mathematical function ( a function that takes arguments and returns a value) If the program is executed  this function is logically evaluated as needed.
it treats computation as the evaluation of the mathematical functions and
avoids the changing states of mutable data. is a kinda of a declarative programming paradigm 
which basically means programs are written with expressions instead of statements
examples can be perl, php, c++ and c#
Whereas a procedural language performs a series of sequential steps.With everything done in a specific order.



Check out wikipedia to find out more about programming paradigm.
From yours truly peace!
