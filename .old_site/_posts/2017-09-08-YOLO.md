YOLO
<pre>yesterday we were watching Ted talks at the coding ground 
and i come across this interesting talk about YOLO by 
Joseph Redmond 

so YOLO is a "a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation."
from what i understand this system is the best image detection system yet.=, its very impressive how the system 
can detect an object,a person and animal all in one image.
it can also detect the above in a video in real time.
it used a model called Darknet.
Darknet prints out the objects detected in an image 
and the duration it took to locate the objects.and its open source.
i personally think that this is one of the coolest stuff
to get more info on all of this please check out the link below or you can check out tedtalks on youtube to find out about more interesting stuff 
from yours truly peace!!
