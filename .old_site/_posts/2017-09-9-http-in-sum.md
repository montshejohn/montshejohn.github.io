hi there..

Have you wondered what those four letter you see almost everyday of your life mean ? I mean those four letter that appear
on your browser the HTTP? if you did and you are not sure what they mean then you have come to the right place I will like to share with you some information on them.
first of all the letter are abbreviated the full meaning is
Hyper-Text-Transfer-Protocol kind of cool name don't you think?
but what does it mean you ask ? well the first word means a text displayed on electronic devices with reference to links.I am not gonna go on to others as i assume we all know what transfer and protocol mean, OK so back to HTTP
it is said to be " an application protocol for distributed collaborative and hypermedia information systems "
its is also said that HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the world wide web.
its development was initiated by sir Tim-Berners-lee at CERN in 1989

on wiki it says that HTTP functions a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. theres an example there is goes like this |a web browser eg chrome may be the client and the application running on a computer hosting the website may be the server so so the clients submits an HTTP request message to the server remember the server is your node so the server provides resources such as your HTML files and other content or it can perform other functions on behalf of the client which is the browser.
HTTP is also designed to permit network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers in other words this means with HTTP proxies HTTP can facilitate private network for clients..

so that's HTTP for you
to get more information on HTTP please visit my source at

from your truly peace!
