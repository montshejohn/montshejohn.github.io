###Shu ha ri : how we learn.

Monday: 24/07/2017

Hey there!

Hope you doing well there.
have you asked your self ,how do we learn? Or maybe just like me you thought that learning is just something that just happens naturally without any concept behind it.

guess what theres actually some concepts behind this learning thing, and one of them is what we call SHUHARI<br> you probably thinking that the name sounds weird right ? I know I thought so as well anyway it's a Japanese martial art concept that describes the stages of learning to mastery look up shuhari on wiki to find out more about this concept it will change your life!
