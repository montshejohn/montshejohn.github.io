Sum All Primes

I must say this challenge is Kinda difficult i have  spent almost 3 hours trying to figure it out, trying to come up with a good 

algo that will work as i planned..

here is what we needed to do :

Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

The provided number may not be a prime.

Getting prime numbers is not easy i must tell you i read up on methods that i can use 
but i believe they are too complex. 
hopefully with my second attempt tomorrow i might get it right
