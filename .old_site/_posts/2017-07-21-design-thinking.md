### design thinking

friday: 21/07/2017

Hi there! Hope you had a good da. This is yours truly Johannes Mokgokong and today s blog is about design thinking.

SO Design Thinking is a design methodology that provides a solution-based approach to solving problems.it said to be useful in solving 
problems that are difficult or not clear.it done so by understating what needs to be done or rather what the customer or consumer needs
This is mainly done through brainstorming and prototyping.

Then again there are five stages of design thinking, I am list them below in summary:

1. Empathise 
it is said that the first stage of design thinking is to understand whats need and show feelings on whats needed
This may involve consulting , observation and involving yourself in the physical environment in order to have a deeper understanding on what the people want.

2. Define (the Problem)
well at this stage u will in in possession of information that you possessed from the first stage
So with that said analysis is required in order to define the problems that you have identified up to this point.

3. ideate 
at this stage you are ready t formulate a plan or an idea on what you have identified from your users or consumers

4. prototype
so now with an idea in place you can now put the plan into action in a scale-down inexpensive way

5. test
The last part will be to test if the product really works as planned or what. The results nay be used to redefine the idea or inform the user on they're understanding.

thats a summary on design thinking  i tried simplifying it if you feel that you need more info please visit wiki and check out design thinking t

thanks!
