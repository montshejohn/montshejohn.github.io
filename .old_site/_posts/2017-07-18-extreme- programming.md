Hello there! Welcome to yet another awesome blog post well it's not that awesome � but it  will  get there . So thank you for reading.
lets get right on to it, today s blog is about a book i read by Kent back extreme programming 
it's an interesting book i must say besides the fact that its written by one of the best programmers out there�  so the book is conceived to address
the specific needs of software development conducted by small teams. so i my self i am relatively new  to this programming space and so�far I�ve experienced a few fundamentals of the book, like 
Pair programming, code review  and practising the art of using oral communication in problem solving.

the book was referred to me by the coding ground team, i haven�t really finished the book my 
self but so far i have reasons to believe that its an interesting book to read especially for people in the computing field because of this book the ways of software development have improved�. now thats my views pls go read the book�if book read please feel free to add on
