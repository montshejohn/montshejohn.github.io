for weeks now I thought my approach to learning was good enough  only to find out days ago that its actually kind of flawed.

I thought i was learning to understand and at the same time moving fast enough, I have come to realize that with my approach, I am moving too fast without making sure that I understand things I learn about.

Learning how to write clean, readable code that does what it's actually intended for. The learning environment is awesome our mentors are one the most friendliest and patient people because of this learning becomes a breeze for me and my fellow students.

now on my side the things that I realized are slowing me down are these:

1.Not asking questions. 

We have been told quite a lot of times to do that, to ask questions  and honestly i don't really have a valid reason  why i don't
do that as often as i should as much as  I rely on the internet for ideas but now i think input from the mentors could be much more easier to understand

2. Naming

file names variable names etc... most people  aren't really good at this i know but i wish to improve from where i stand with less use 
of shortcuts when naming variable and making my file names more verbose I believe like that  I can get better

3. Planning 

when given a task I usually don't take time to think about the task,engage problem solving techniques and I would normally assume that 
I know exactly what to do and jump straight in and make things work right away, guess what? Most of the time if not all the time it doesn't work out. So i guess planning is deserves a spot in this list.

4. explaining 

 I personally feel like i need to work on learning how to explain my code, and the things i believe to understand. That could  help me get a firmer grasp on the things that i believe to understand and even give me feedback on what i need to improve on.

5. Thinking skills/Logical thinking

I believe that I am a fairly good chess player and a game of chess requires logic,strategy and focus.
 working on applying all those to my learning can make a huge difference.
 
 Working on all five of these minor
 set backs could improve my learning and enhance my/our almost acquired skill of writing code rapidly.
