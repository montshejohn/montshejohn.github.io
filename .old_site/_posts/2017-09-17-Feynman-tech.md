 the Feynman Technique.

Thursday morning about twenty minutes to nine i am on 
Medium.com reading a few blogs u know to learn something new
i came across one blog in the category of personal growth and its about the secret algorithm behind learning. 
theres a Nobel winning physicist called Richard Feynman 
it said that the man understood the difference between knowing something and knowing the name of something which is one of the most important reasons for his success.
whats the difference really ?
well knowing something is when you are fully capable of explaining what you know in a more simple way breaking it down to the most simplest form and knowing the name of something is when you know what an Algo is but cant really explain what it does in the simplest form thats what i think. now the blog a was reading said that Feynman stumbled upon a formula for leaning that helps one learn anything deeper and faster.It doesn't even matter what concept you want to learn it works for everything they say.
the formula is called the Feynman Technique...
okay it sounds legit how does it work?
there are steps to this formula here are a few in simple terms "you see what i did there?"
OK so the first one is 
1. Teach what you think you know to a child
hmmm sounds like a pretty easy to do right give it try!
2.Review 
theres a huge possibility that you may come across words you cant explain to child or concepts you know but cant put them in simple terms when doing the first step which is teaching a child..if true thats when this second step comes to play review the limits you have in understanding something...
there about four steps to this formula please visit this 
URL below to find out more about it lemme go find some kid an teach him something
