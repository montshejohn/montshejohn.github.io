# What is Markdown

According to Wikipedia markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax

designed so that it can be converted to HTML and other formats as well this blog is also written in markdown.

here is how I you can build a Markdown previewed in react.js

# What you will need

to be able to start with this project you will need a few things which are

basic knowledge of react which means u must at least the basics of HTML,JavaScript and CSS for your styling.

you can choose to work on react locally on your machine or on code pen, if you choose to work locally and you are

not really sure on how,to start you can visit this [react js create my app](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

there is s a create my-app package there that you can install it will set up a proper react working environment for you,

with that set up here is what you will need for the layout.

You will need a Textarea where the input of the markdown text will be and because we creating a markdown you

will also need an output you can use a div element or p element for this whatever satisfies your fancy

for a quick layout you can use react-bootstrap this sorts out most stuff for you.

you can install react-bootstrap like this "npm --save react-bootstrap" or go to this link to read their docs

and get a feel of how things work [react bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/forms/)

that saves most of your time

last but not least you will need a package called "marked".

Marked is a low-level markdown compiler implementing all markdown features from the supported flavors &

specifications
