### software development methodology 

 Hi there welcome to yet another blog by yours truly thank you for reading.
So today we will be looking at another software methodology, its called Agile development it describes  as set of values and principles in software development just, like extreme programming. I  have reasons to believe that these two are somehow familiar in a way. Now heres a  little bit of info on Agile
 It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

 I have reason to believe its something worth checking out it can be a  part of a problem  solving  technique,if you like.

Thanks again for visiting
From yours truly peace! http://www.danube.com/docs/Intro_to_Agile.pdf
