Usually when we read we tend to read the whole passage or instruction once then we assume that we understand what is said or required from that.
Yesterday on free code camp as I was busy with the twitch,tv project I came across a user story of which I had to fulfill, reading it once, I assumed I 
I have a clear description of what is required that was my first mistake "assuming that I know what's required and not making sure that i understand" that mistake lead me to wasting time doing 
something that wasn't part of the requirements.if only I read carefully and made sure I understand what's been said I could have used my time effectively and 
fulfilled the required user stories earlier.

With that I have come to understand that reading fast is not for everyone,well thought I was the type that reads and understands fast but I guess not.
With the experience I had I now know that I have to follow reading principles(  "how to read a book" article for example) and read more often than I do, As well as
to try to read a book, or blog every single day.
Understanding is a core concept in reading because if one doesn't read to understand the why read, and again assuming that one understands what is written 
is something really dangerous, take time when reading instructions or things like that, read the line or passage over and over again making sure that 
you get the idea of it.

Sometimes we think we understand things because we fill that once is enough and maybe for something like short instructions etc this is true 
but one can never go wrong with making sure that one understand what he/she reads.
