It's been almost three months at The Coding Ground, I must say we are learning a lot,so
far we covered html 5, bootstrap, and CSS this to me is really awesome I mean just a while ago, months ago 
I did not know jack about any of the above mentioned. But right now I think I am  well-informed.
For a while I thought that I am  not clever enough to reach into the coding scene, well guess what,
all that does not  really matter one doesn't have to be super smart to understand what's what in
this space, One only needs commitment and the right attitude to learn anybody can do this.
Now just because anybody can do this learn to code I have come to understand that it doesn't mean its gonna be easy
sometimes it is nerve wrecking but I guess that is   part of the  learning process and because of commitment I will be able to master my 
craft soon.
Right now we are busy with  basic JavaScript on FreeCodecamp and its a bit challenging as well 
but thanks to our mentors things become much simpler with their guidance...
